{"name":"Open-sensor-platform","tagline":"Open Sensor Platform project","body":"open-sensor-platform\r\n====================\r\n\r\nOpen Sensor Platform (OSP) is open source software built to enable\r\nsystems with sensor hubs.  It is a framework specifically for sensor\r\ndata acquisition, communication, and interpretation.  The embedded\r\ncode is in C to allow easy compatibility with any CPU architecture or\r\nreal-time operating system.  The linux code allows easy implementation\r\nof sensor hub data up to an Application Processor (AP) an Android\r\nHardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).  The framework is simple and\r\nflexible enough to be extended to more use-cases.\r\n\r\nThis project can be used to support various embedded sensor\r\napplications such as:\r\n  * Android KitKat compliant buffering sensor hubs,\r\n  * always-on context aware hubs,\r\n  * multi-function wearable devices.\r\n\r\n### Community Contributions\r\n\r\nOSP encourages developers to focus on creating low-level applications\r\nfor sensors rather than reinventing the wheel on the sensor interface.\r\nBy open sourcing this software, community contributions can continue\r\nto develop this framework.  Ports of OSP to other platforms can be\r\ncontributed to this project.\r\n\r\nOSP is released by Sensor Platforms Inc. under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n### Trying it out\r\n\r\nA reference sensor hub example is provided for easily available hardware: \r\n  * an STEVAL board with ARM-CortexM3 based microprocessor and 9-axis sensors attached,\r\n  * a Nexus7 tablet with KitKat connected over I2C to the STEVAL board as a sensor hub.\r\n\r\nThis example can be ported to a Cortex-M0+, or any other MCU or DSP\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nThe example uses the Keil-MDK toolchain, but\r\nfuture releases will utilize gcc under Keil as well as full\r\ngcc/Makefile based build system.\r\n\r\nThe project uses the Keil RTX Real Time Operating system and will\r\neventually leverage the platform agnostic CMSIS APIs.\r\n\r\n### Additional Questions\r\n\r\nRefer to the detailed [FAQ](https://github.com/sensorplatforms/open-sensor-platform/wiki) on the wiki section of this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Project Structure\r\n  * doc - Doxygen creation\r\n  * embedded - sensor hub code \r\n  * external - Source code, library, documentation, algorithms, etc. from external sources available under open-source license\r\n  * linux - Android application processor code\r\n","google":"open sensor platform, internet of things, iot, wearables, wearable, sensor hub, sensor, sensors, embedded sensor","note":"Don't delete this file!
